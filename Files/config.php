     * The ipcheck, checks if your IP is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 type, if none of these, it will kill.
     * this might shut a few users out, so you can turn it off by changing the $ipcheck variable to 'off'
     ****************
     * The allow_spec_q variable specifies if Special queries (eg. USE databasr and SHOW DATABASES) are allowed.
     * By default, they are not, meaning $allow_spec_q = false;
     * To allow them, change $allow_spec_q to TRUE ($allow_spec_q = true;)
     ****************
     * The show_full_info variable lets you decide wether to show the Build and Alpha/Beta/SP markings in the HTML or not.
     * Change the value to TRUE to show them, or FALSE to turn them off.
     * Default = true;
