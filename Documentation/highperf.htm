		<p class="subTitle">XMB had a previously unfounded reputation as a resource hog. 
			Occasionally, it was. No longer.</p>
		<p>XMB 1.9.1 is highly tuned for high volume web sites, with nearly all end-user 
			pages requiring no more than 15 SQL queries. All mainstream high frequency 
			queries use indexes, have limits, and are tuned to work efficiently with MySQL 
			4.0.x and later.
		</p>
		<p>XMB 1.9.1 optimizes output to pump the minimum amount of data to display a page, 
			and attachments are cache friendly. Gzip compression is on by default where it 
			is available. Future work on XMB 2.0 will further improve XMB’s scalability.
		</p>
		<p>Like all software, XMB’s performance is dependant upon three factors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>CPU utilization
				</p>
			<li>
				<p>Network latency and utilization</p>
			<li>
				<p>Disk I/O (particularly with regard to heavy attachment pages)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some of these can really make or break your web site.
		</p>
		<h1><a name="_Toc83140565">Quick Wins</a></h1>
		<h2>Turn off the server load / SQL queries / PHP time footer
		</h2>
		<p>This feature, although interesting, adds unnecessary overhead on the busiest of 
			forums.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140580">Turn on persistent connections</a></h2>
		<p>By default, XMB does not use persistent connections. This is due to a bug with 
			PHP and Apache 2.0 in module mode, where multi-threaded access can be buggy. 
			Eventually, this will be fixed by PHP when they get their act together. 
			However, persistent connections are a win for busy web sites. What it means is 
			that occasionally post.php and other places in the code which update the 
			database may occasionally lose coherency and a member will lose their post. You 
			can fix such lossage by checking for Orphaned Threads and deleting orphaned 
			attachments in the Administration Control panel.
		</p>
		<p><img border="0" src="images/high_p1.gif" width="723" height="473"></p>
		<p>The above gives you an idea of the performance of XMB 1.9.1. It can cope with 
			nearly twice as many simultaneous users as XMB 1.8 SP3. The time to deliver a 
			page to the last byte does not change that much, however.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140566">PHP Accelerators</a></h2>
		<p>XMB is compatible with the Zend and other PHP accelerators. These accelerators 
			pre-tokenize PHP and store the byte code for later use. For some pages, such as 
			today.php, post.php and busy polls in viewthread.php, PHP accelerators can be a 
			huge win, whereas other types of pages do not show much of an improvement. 
			Users will rarely see the benefit, but your hoster will thank you. Using an 
			accelerators will decrease CPU utilization and page processing time by 
			approximately 10-50% with no code changes.
		</p>
		<p>Always use a PHP accelerator on busy sites, or on a box hosting many different 
			XMB forums.</p>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140567">House Keeping</a></h2>
		<p>Forums are not supposed to be long-term repositories of information. If you 
			perform basic system administration tasks, such as regularly pruning posts from 
			busy forums, culling old users who have never posted, and using the “Analyze” 
			and “Optimize” administrative functions, your database will be kept as small as 
			possible, and as fast as MySQL can make it.
		</p>
		<p><i>Optimize</i> re-orders indexes and coalesces empty database pages. It should 
			not be over-used as empty pages are re-claimed by MySQL regularly when new data 
			is inserted. About once a week is the right frequency.
		</p>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140568">RAM</a></h2>
		<p>More RAM always helps.
		</p>
		<p>XMB deliberately keeps per-user persistent session size to a minimum, and tries 
			to be as frugal as possible with in-memory data structures. For example, we 
			never use a huge associative array for things such as forum look ups.
		</p>
		<p>PHP will set aside up to 8 MB of data per active user. If there are 200 active 
			users, this is 1.6 GB of RAM required just for PHP alone. Add MySQL, the 
			operating system, and a web server, and 2.0 GB of memory is not enough.
		</p>
		<p>On very busy hosts, add as much RAM as possible to the host. If you add over 2 
			GB, your operating system may need tuning to access RAM over the 2 GB boundary. 
			For example, on Windows 2000, XP and 2003, the /3GB switch is required in 
			boot.ini. Other operating systems have difficulty with more than 4 GB of RAM on 
			x86 32 bit architectures. You should consult your operating systems reference 
			manual for optimal RAM tuning strategies.
		</p>
		<h1><a name="_Toc83140569">Separation of functions</a></h1>
		<p>When all else fails, it’s time for more than one box. Due to XMB 1.9’s 
			historical architecture, there is only one method of separating out 
			functionality – split up the database from the web server. Where possible, use 
			dedicated database servers instead of placing them on the same host. This will 
			immediately about double the total number of users XMB can support compared to 
			a single host.
		</p>
		<p>XMB has been tuned to only return the data it directly requires in every record 
			set it queries. Therefore, network utilization between the database server and 
			XMB will never be very high, even if MySQL has to do a lot of work to satisfy 
			the query.
		</p>
		<h1><a name="_Toc83140570">Tuning the web server</a> and PHP</h1>
		<p>Low cost web hosting plans do not offer a great deal of scope for tuning Apache 
			or IIS. However, in general, it's not the web server causing slowdowns - it's 
			PHP. However, if you're using Apache, make sure there are adequate spare child 
			servers to service every simultaneous request. Read more about tuning here:</p>

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Always use the latest stable version of PHP. No exceptions.</p>
			<li>
				<p>Use the module version of PHP. The CGI version is much slower</p>
			<li>
				<p>Ensure that gzip compression is turned on
				</p>
			<li>
				<p>Use shared memory sessions (compile PHP the <i>with-mm </i>option and set <i>session.save_handler=mm
					</i>in php.ini)</p>
			</li>

		<h1><a name="_Toc83140572">Tuning the database server</a></h1>
		<h3><a name="_Toc83140573">CPU</a></h3>
		<p>Tuning MySQL for CPU utilization is easy: No other processes should be running 
			on the database host other than MySQL.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In addition, under Unix, the command “renice” should be run to re-prioritize 
			MySQL as -20 (the highest priority) as this “fixes” some schedulers to favor 
			MySQL. This can result in up to a 60% performance jump on some SMP machines 
			running Linux and can’t hurt under other Unixes.
		</p>
		<p>Be aware that this will make the machine unresponsive to any other process, 
			including backup programs and other housecleaning tasks, so this change should 
			be trialled carefully.
		</p>
		<p>On Windows hosts, don’t use mysqld, use mysqld-max-nt instead. This has 
			debugging and additional memory checks disabled so it’s faster. The RAM tuning 
			options are still relavant, however.</p>
		<h3><a name="_Toc83140574">RAM</a></h3>
		<p>MySQL is tuned out of the box to only use 16 MB of RAM (and change). Clearly, 
			this is utterly inadequate for all but the most under utilized forums. Ask your 
			hoster to ensure that a sufficient amount of RAM is set aside for MySQL’s use. 
			A good guide to ask for is the size of your indexes, plus say another 25% on 
			top of that, plus “slop” for all the other users who are also using the same 
			database server.</p>
		<p>With XMB, some web pages are requested more frequently than others. For example, 
			viewthread.php is called about twice as often as any other page. The following 
			pages are requested more than 95% of the time:</p>
		<p>viewthread.php forumdisplay.php post.php</p>
		<p>index.php today.php</p>
		<p>In XMB 1.9.1, all of the above pages have been carefully optimized for CPU, 
			network and database utilization. forumdisplay.php, index.php, and today.php 
			will ask for the same data again and again. If MySQL has this data in RAM, XMB 
			will run much faster.
		</p>
		<p>The data most often required is:
		</p>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				All indexes</LI>
			<LI>
				All of the forum table</LI>
			<LI>
				about 5-20% of the threads table (depends on your user’s activities)</LI>
			<LI>
				all of the last posts from the posts table (which is very few rows for most 
				forums)</LI>
			<LI>
				and about 5% of the members table
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P></P>
		<p>
			In a real world example, a large forum’s indexes (the MYI files in the MySQL 
			database data directory) use 43 MB of disk space, and the additional table data 
			adds up to about another 2 MB. For optimal performance, all of this should fit 
			inside MySQL and never be paged out, so asking the hoster if MySQL has at least 
			45 MB of RAM set aside for key_buffer_size is fair and reasonable. Preferably, 
			ask for 128 MB, which should be enough for this site if it’s the only user of 
			the database server.</p>
		<p>In a best case scenario, MySQL will have the ability to ask for (and receive) 
			between 25% and 50% of the host’s RAM, and the rest will be for the operating 
			system and its data caches. MySQL relies upon the OS’s caching for reads, so 
			don’t give MySQL too much RAM. For a database server with 2 GB of RAM, the 
			following command will immensely boost MySQL performance for up to 200 
			simultaneous sessions:</p>
		<p>mysqld_safe --key_buffer_size=1024M --table_cache=256 \</p>
		<p>
			--sort_buffer_size=64M --read_buffer_size=16M –max-connections=200</p>
		<h3><a name="_Toc83140575">Data I/O</a></h3>
		<p>MySQL is a total disk hog. All database servers are. The correct layout of the 
			underlying disks should be along the lines of:</p>
		<p>Three physical disks or RAID sets:</p>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<p>disk0 Operating system and page file</p>
			<p>disk1 MySQL data
			</p>
			<p>disk2 MySQL logs and indexes</p>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<p>Three spindles will improve the performance of MySQL as tables and indexes can 
			be read and written to concurrently.
		</p>
		<p>Generally speaking, RAID 5 on a database server is a no-no due to its very 
			intensive and slow data protection scheme. For most database servers, RAID 0 
			(mirroring) is a better option as reads are usually performed in parallel from 
			both disks and writes are about as fast as a normal single disk. XMB’s data 
			access patterns are very heavy reading, and light writing (about 95-99% 
			reading).
		</p>
		<h1><a name="_Toc83140576">Future Work</a></h1>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140577">Cascading style sheets, real attachments, and new theme 
				engine</a></h2>
		<p>XMB currently stores everything in the database. Although this is flexible, it 
			can be slow. XMB 2.0 will use on-disk CSS / XHTML stylesheets, attachments and 
			themes. This will make XMB far more cache friendly, and dramatically reduce the 
			work MySQL has to perform on image heavy web pages.</p>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140578">Scale out</a></h2>
		<p>XMB 1.9 does not support scale out, such as using a separate attachments server, 
			or having a dedicated post server. Some scale-out options will be supported by 
			2.0 as long as it doesn’t overly complicate the code.</p>
		<h2><a name="_Toc83140579">Web Farms</a>
		</h2>
		<p>Web farms (collections of front end web servers with one or more back end 
			database servers) are not supported at this time. XMB 2.0 will natively support 
			web farms.
		</p>
		1.9 has no coherency protocol in place to prevent data corruption when two 
		posters post at the same time. There is one exception to the web farm rule: one 
		poster and many, many readers. This works due to the only poster is very 
		unlikely to post from two different machines at the same time. There are few 
		examples of this style of forum in existence, but examples may include 
		celebrity blogging and very busy product catalogs.
