		<p class="subTitle">1) &quot;Help! I can't log into my new boards!&quot;</P>
		<br />
			<p>
			This is a common issue with new installs and is usually due to the $full_url
			not being filled our correctly in your config.php file.
		</p>
		<p>Open your config.php file in a text editor and find the *// Path-settings*
			section. Within that section you will see</p>
		<p>$full_url = 'FULLURL';</p>
		<p>You need to make sure to replace the &quot;FULLURL&quot; with the url to your
			forums - and don't forget the trailing forward slash. For example,
		</p>
		<p>$full_url = '<a href="http://forums.xmbforum.com/">http://forums.xmbforum.com/</a>';
		</p>
		<p>Save the config.php file and upload to your server. 99% of the time this will
			clear up any &quot;new install&quot; login issues.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you still have login issues after checking the above solution please consult
			the following &quot;How To&quot; threads on our support forums:</p>

		<p class="subTitle">&quot;I get a Column count not found at row 1 error!&quot;</p>
		<br />
		<p>This is due to hacks. XMB 1.9.5 will NEVER display this message as all SQL
			queries it issues are fully specified. If you have hacks installed, you will
			need to ask for support from the person you obtained the hack from.
		</p>
		<p>However, the best bet to resolve this issue is to return XMB 1.9.5 to pristine
			condition by <a href="upgrade.htm">performing an upgrade</a>. Just follow
			the steps described in the upgrade documentation. The upgrade basically
			restores your board to correct working condition.<br>

		<p class="subTitle">&quot;A few of my new members are getting an error message and
			they are not being allowed to register! The error message is 'Access to this
			website is currently not possible as your hostname/IP appears suspicious' -
			what is that all about?!</p>
			<br>
			<p>The error message &quot;Access to this website is currently not possible as
			your hostname/IP appears suspicious&quot; is due to a &quot;check&quot;
			installed by default to prevent any suspicious activity that could harm your
			forums. Sometimes it can get in the way of valid registrations. This is
			particularly true in countries like Australia where all the major ISPs use
			transparent proxies. If many users get this message, just turn the check off.</p>
		<p>You can turn off this check by opening your config.php file in a text editor.
			Find the &quot;// Registration settings&quot; section and change $ipcheck to
			&quot;off&quot; instead of the default &quot;on&quot;. Save the config.php file
			and upload to your server.</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="subTitle">3) &quot;I tried to register a new account for my forum but I
			get this error: 'Error: You have already registered today, you can re-register
			again in 24 hours' - why is this happening?!</p>
			<br>
			<p>This is due to a check in the config.php file. You can turn of the check by
			opening your config.php file in a text editor and looking in the &quot;//
			Registration settings&quot; section and changing $ipreg to &quot;off&quot;
			instead of the default &quot;on&quot;. Save the config.php file and upload to
			your server.</p>
