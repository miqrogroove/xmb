<h4>XMB 1.9.1 Nexus - Requirements</h4>

<p>To install and run an XMB forum your web host must include both MySQL and PHP with your account. These are essential
in running the forum software. If your hoster does not have these available, check the "Hosting" forum on XMB
<a href="http://www.xmbforum.com/community/forums/">http://www.xmbforum.com/community/forums</a>. Members regularly post "finds" or offer hosting.</p>

<p>You may be interested in a "free" hosting plan. There are many available - try searching on Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/">google.com</a>) or
Yahoo (<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">yahoo.com</a>) for a free PHP/MySQL host. You may find these "free" hosting services a bit limiting, especially as
your forum grows into a popular and busy site. In which case, you may want to consider finding a host
which although "not
free", can offer you stability and room to grow.</p>

<p>For that reason we suggest checking out XMB hosting, which starts as low as &pound;22.27 / $35 Yearly for a
Ensim/Cpanel hosting plan. http://www.xmbforum.com/hosting</p>

<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disk space, processor load and bandwidth</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">XMB uses about 1 MB of disk space once
installed. Most forums will use less than 20 MB of disk space between the PHP
files and database usage, and use less than 100 MB of network bandwidth a month.
Careful attention to pruning old posts can keep total disk space to acceptable
levels for light usage.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">XMB 1.9.1 is very CPU efficient compared to
previous versions. Most hosts should not see any significant load from XMB until
large numbers of users are active on a single host (such as about 200
simultaneous requests in flight).</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">A busy forum with 2,500 users, 125,000
posts, 20,000 attachments, and 35,000 U2U's uses about 400 MB of disk space, and
will normally consume about 20-25 Gb of bandwidth per month. You should be on a
dedicated server with this level of activity.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Minimum: 3.00 (Not recommended)</p>
<p>Recommended: XMB recommends the current 4.0.x branch for stability and
security reasons. </p>
<p>XMB 1.9.1 works just fine with MySQL 5.0, but does not use any MySQL 5.0
features.</p>
<p>PHP: </p>
<p>Minimum: 4.1.0 - note this version has severe security issues. Not
recommended.</p>
<p>Recommended: Latest 4.x series (4.3.8 at the time of writing). </p>
<p>XMB works just fine with PHP5 but does not take advantage of the shiny new
PHP 5.0 features. </p>

<p><strong><em>Not required but strongly suggested:</em></strong></p>
<p>A good FTP program for transferring your files to and from your web space. There are several good, free FTP clients
out there - here are a couple you could check out: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Windows XP's built in
	<a href="ms-its:C:/WINDOWS/Help/filefold.chm::/using_webfolders_for_file_transfer.htm">
	web folders</a> </li>
	<li>FTP Commander 7.0 -
	<a
href="http://www.internet-soft.com/ftpcomm.htm" target="_blank">www.internet-soft.com/ftpcomm.htm</a></li>
	<li>Core FTP Lite - <a href="http://www.coreftp.com/" target="_blank">www.coreftp.com/</a></li>
	<li>FileZilla Open Source FTP / SFTP Client -
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/"
target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/</a></li>
	<li>SmartFTP - <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/" target="_blank">www.smartftp.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another suggestion is a good text editor. PHP files require a plain text editor - don't use your Cpanel File
Manager, MSWord or any other word processor for the editing of your files.</p>

<p>Probably the best "free" text editor is: Crimson Editor - <a
href="http://crimsoneditor.com/">http://crimsoneditor.com/</a><br />
<a href="http://www.textpad.com/">http://www.textpad.com/</a> is a very good (free) choice aswell.</p>

<p>Again - thank you for downloading and using XMB Forums!</p>

<br />
<br />
 <a id="install" name="install"></a>
<h4>Installing XMB 1.9</h4>
  <p>Thank you for choosing XMB 1.9.1 Nexus, created by Aventure Media & The XMB Group.
  </p>
  <p>Below is a guide on how to Install XMB 1.9.1 Nexus.</p>
  <p> <b>1) Before you Begin</b></p>
<p> Make sure that you have enough web space for your forum, and that
    your hosting account includes both PHP and mySQL.</p>
<p> Create a database for your forums, using the MySQL Management Tool
    from your site's Control Panel or by using mysql's administration tool
directly.</p>
<p> Please note the database name ($dbname), username ($dbuser) and password ($dbpw).
  </p>
  <p><b>2) Upload </b> </p>
<p>Upload all the files from the distribution to your site. Everything in the &quot;Files&quot;
folder requires uploading.<br />
    <br />
    <i>chmod 666 config.php </i> </p>
<p>Unless your hoster is using Windows Server and IIS (rare), the file
permissions on the configuration file need to be temporarily changed to allow
the installation to complete. There are many ways to achieve this. In many FTP
clients, you right on a file and choose chmod or Change Attributes or similar.
Then check all check marks in the permissions area, or enter in
    666 where it shows a textbox with the numbers: 644. This represents:</p>
<ul>
	<li>user: read/write</li>
	<li>group: read/write</li>
	<li>other: read/write</li>
</ul>
<p>You may need to do this in your hoster's CPanel or via shell access. If you
can't work it out, ask your hoster for help. </p>
<p>Once your installation has completed, this should be set back to 644. </p>
<p> <br />
    <b>3) Installation</b></p>
<p><i><b>*!* Please note that XMB 1.9.1 Nexus Final Installation is different from
    the older versions and builds. *!*</b></i></p>
<ul>
	<li>Start your web browser </li>
	<li>Input the URL where your forum will be located and then add <i>/install/index.php
	</i>to the end </li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
    </p>
<ul>
	<li>http://<a href="http://www.mydomain.com/forums/install/index.php">www.mydomain.com/forums/install/index.php</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If you have typed the installation URL correctly, you will see the Welcome Image to XMB 1.9.1 Nexus.
	Click on it to begin installation.</li>
	<li>The second page is the XMB Version Check. This is used to show you
    the most recent build of XMB Forum. If your version is earlier, go get a
	later version as it'll be more secure and contain fewer bugs. However, if
	you have the latest version, click on the 'Install XMB 1.9.1 Final' button to proceed.</li>
	<li>Read and understand the XMB 1.9.1 Nexus License Agreement. If you're
	prepared to accept it, 'I agree to terms' button
    to proceed. </li>
	<li>Next up is the Configuration File Setup Page. This is the most important
	step. Input the required database
    name, username, password from above where you configured the database. </li>
	<li>The only other mandatory field is &quot;Full URL&quot;. The Full URL helps the
	forum base itself relative to wherever you need it, and allows you to move
	XMB easily between hosters if you need it. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you're forum is going to be at </p>
<p><a href="http://www.example.com/forum/">http://www.example.com/forum/</a></p>
<p>then, that's the full URL. Simple! Remember to put a slash at the end. </p>
<ul>
	<li>The other settings are optional,
    but you may activate them if you wish. The most important to note is &quot;ipreg&quot;.
	This is not a useful setting in many countries where ISPs use transparent
	proxies. Leaving this in the &quot;on&quot; state stops more than a couple of
	registrations per day. </li>
	<li>Once finished with the configuration choices, click on the 'Configure'
    button to proceed. If the file permissions on config.php are correct, XMB
	will have written out a correct config.php.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The installer automatically installs XMB 1.9.1 Nexus on to your database.</li>
	<li>Scroll down to the end of the page, and click on 'here' to redirect to your
    forums. </li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>* If you have WARNINGS from the Installer, it will tell you why it has
    stopped the installation process, contact your host if it has issues related
    to PHP or mySQL versions. * </b></i></p>
<p><b>Post-installation Checks</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure the file permissions of config.php are mode 644 (or user:
	read/write, group / other: read only)</li>
	<li>Delete the /install/ folder in FTP</li>
	<li>Register on your forums as soon as you can as the first account is the
	Super Administrator. If you find you can't register as Super Administrator,
	remove the xmb_settings table in mysql and restart the installation process.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4) Your Forum </b></p>
<p>Have fun with
    your newly installed forum! - Be sure to REGISTER your new account at your
    forums, you will automatically become a Super Administrator of your forums.
    </p>
<p>To edit different aspects of your forum, click on Administration Panel,
    then you will see links to different settings for your forums. </p>
<p>Please read
    the other documentation included in this installation package for additional
    instructions and tips!</p>
<p><b>About hacks</b></p>

</b><br>
Make sure to always perform these steps before using *ANY* upgrade script!<br>
<br>
* backup all the data in your database <br>
* backup all your forum's files <br>
<br>
Although this is common sense, it's often forgotten. <br>
<br>
<b>Database Hacks </b><br>
<br>
!!! This upgrade works most of the time when hacks are installed. !!!<br>
!!! However, hack data will be destroyed by this utility !!!<br>
!!! Proceed with extreme caution if you want to keep your hack data !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Compatibility<br>
</b><br>
Any version of XMB 1.11c or higher <br>
- It does not work with earlier versions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Required Files:<br>
<br>
* upgrade.lib.php<br>
* upgrade.php<br>
* install.css<br>
* XMB_*.xmb (at the time of writing, XMB_1_9-final.xmb)<br>
<br>
The createFile.php script and this readme should not be uploaded to your system.
This script creates the schema for XMB developers or you if you're particularly
keen :)<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Upgrade Instructions </b><br>
<br>
Disable posting to your board in Admin -&gt; Settings<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2"><span style="background-color: #FF0000">0. Backup your
database </span></font></b><br>
1. Backup all your forum's files<br>
2. Upload all of Nexus 1.9's files over the top of your existing forum files<br>
3. Delete ./install/<br>
4. Edit the new config.php to suit your needs<br>
5. Upload upgrade.php, upgrade.lib.php, install.css to your forum<br>
6. Run http://www.yourdomain.com/pathtoyourforum/upgrade.php<br>
7. When it succeeds, check that upgrade.php, upgrade.lib.php, install.css, and
xmb_*.xmb have <br>
been deleted.<br>
8. Log on your shiny new 1.9.1 board <br>
9. Turn on the board in Admin -&gt; Settings. Adjust other new settings as you see
fit. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Keeping XMB healthy</b><br>
<br>
If your database is not looked after regularly, it can slow down. XMB 1.9.1 has
many performance<br>
improvements which can be best utilized with a healthy database. XMB recommends
administrators <br>
use Admin -&gt; Analyze on their databases weekly, followed by Admin -&gt; Optimize.
This keeps your <br>
board in the best possible shape. Try it now!<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Basic system administration</b><br>
<br>
You should find out if your hoster does backups for you. If they don't, you need
to take backups<br>
manually. XMB 1.9.1 has a backup utility, but it is best if you use your hoster's
utilities (such as <br>
myPhpAdmin or the mysqldump tool for this purpose. Backups should be taken about
once a week, and<br>
more often for very busy sites.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
<br>
All software has bugs, XMB included. You should check back with http://www.xmbforum.com/
regularly<br>
to see if you need to install patches. When customizing your board, remember the
following:<br>
<br>
* Changes to themes are supported<br>
* Modifications to XMB's PHP files, or to the database schema, or altering
templates within the <br>
Admin -&gt; Templates area makes it much harder for *YOU* to upgrade to the next
service pack or a<br>
later version of XMB. <br>
<br>
Try to keep the number of hacks down, and consider using &quot;diff&quot; to allow you to
reapply them if you need<br>
to reload XMB from scratch. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Known issues</b><br>
<br>
The upgrade is quite resource-intensive, especially with large databases. <br>
- The script might time out or look to be inactive <br>
- The script can consume large amounts of disk space, up to twice the amount you
are currently<br>
- using. Make sure you have enough room!<br>
<br>
We're still working on this. <br>
You should now be successfully upgraded to 1.9.1 Nexus!</p>

<hr noshade />
<p><strong>"Help! I can't log into my new boards!"</strong><br />
This is a common issue with new installs and is usually due to the $full_url not being filled our correctly in your
config.php file. Open your config.php file in a text editor and find the *// Path-settingssection. Within that section
you will see $full_url = 'http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/';</p>

<p>You need to make sure to replace the "http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/" with the url to your forums - and
don't forget the trailing forward slash. Save the config.php file and upload to your server.<br />
99% of the time this will clear up any "new install" login issues.</p>

<p>If you still have login issues after checking the above solution please consult the following "How To" threads on
our support forums:<br />
 <a href="http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/viewthread.php?tid=740614" target="_blank">How To: Enable/Delete
Cookies</a><br />
 <a href="http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/viewthread.php?tid=740632" target="_blank">How To: Deal with
Login/Logout Issues</a></p>

<p>If all of the above fail to help please post your question in our support forums (listed above) and we will be happy
to help from there.</p>

<p><strong>"I just installed the forums and it seemed to go well...but I have an error message when I go to the
Administration Panel. The error says: 'Wrong File permissions set. Please CHMOD the cplogfile.php to 777'. What do I do
now?!"</strong></p>

<p>This is actually a normal occurrence and simply involves setting the permissions on the cplogfile.php so that it can
be written to. There is a "How To" in our How To Forum that will help you deal with this error. You will find it
here:<br />
<a href="http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/viewthread.php?tid=741288" target="_blank">How To: CHMOD/Set File
Permissions</a></p>

<p>If you continue to have permission/chmod problems or don't understand the above "How To" please post your question
in our support forums (listed above) and we will be happy to help from there.</p>

<p><strong>"A few of my new members are getting an error message and they are not being allowed to register! The error
message is 'Access to this website is currently not possible as your hostname/IP appears suspicious' - what is that all
about?!</strong></p>

<p>The error message "Access to this website is currently not possible as your hostname/IP appears suspicious" is due
to a "check" installed by default to prevent any suspicious activity that could harm your forums. Sometimes it can get
in the way of valid registrations. You can "undo" this check by opening your config.php file in a text editor and
looking in the "// Registration settings" section and changing $ipcheck to "off" instead of the default "on". Save the
config.php file and upload to your server.</p>

<p><strong>"I tried to register a new account for my forum but I get this error: 'Error: You have already registered
today, you can re-register again in 24 hours' - why is this happening?!</strong></p>
  <p>Again, like the question/answer above, this is due to a "check" in the config.php
    file. You can "undo" this check by opening your config.php file in a text
    editor and looking in the "// Registration settings" section and changing
    $ipreg to "off" instead of the default "on". Save the config.php file and
    upload to your server.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>"I get a Column count not found at row 1 error!"</strong></p>
  <p>Go to <a href="http://www.xmbhacks.co.uk/community/boards/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.xmbhacks.co.uk/community/boards/</a>,
	register, then first click Search. The XMB Forum no longer provides supports
	for hacks. </p>

<h4>XMB 1.9.1 Nexus - Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h4>

<p>Here is a short list of frequently asked questions and answers (FAQ) to get you started with your forums. For a more
in depth study of the forums we suggest you read through the support threads/posts in the Support Forums. The forums
are located at http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/ - or if you are a Premiere Member you may get personalize
support at our "Members" forum - http://www.xmbforum.com/members/community/. For information on purchasing a Membership
or Support Plan please visit the XMB Store - http://www.xmbforum.com/store/ - and take a look around.</p>

<p>Also note that your forums also contain a "Frequently Asked Questions" section - look for the "FAQ" link in the
forums header menu.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What are the duties and differences between the staff ranks?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Below is a brief, but comprehensive, description of the different ranks: Super Administrator:
Unlimited and Full Access to Administration Panel and full control of the board.</p>

<p>This is a relatively simple description of the rank system in XMB to get you started. The rank system can be altered
in Administration Panel &gt; User Ranks. A description of the moderation tools is also provided.</p>

<p><strong>Super Administrator</strong> The Super Administrator is the highest rank. The first person to register on
your board is automatically assigned this rank. They can use all of the moderation options in threads/posts in all
forums, and they have access to every feature in the Administrator Panel.</p>

<p><strong>Administrator</strong> The Administrator rank can moderate all forums and has access to nearly all of the
administration panel. The only functions of the administration panel they cannot access is the Upgrade section. They
also cannot read other member's u2u inboxes, or edit other member's profiles.</p>

<p><strong>Super Moderator</strong> The Super Moderator has access to the moderating tools for all the forums, but they
cannot access the administration panel.</p>

<p><strong>Moderator</strong> Moderators has access to the moderating tools for a specified forum or forums. The forums
that they moderate can be altered by an Administrator/Super Administrator by accessing the Administration Panel feature
"Moderators".</p>

<p><strong>Member</strong> The Member rank is the default rank that is set when a user registers. Under the default
settings, members can post topics, reply to topics and edit their own posts in any public forum. However, this can be
changed by altering the settings in Administration Panel &gt; Forums &gt; More Options.</p>

<p><strong>Banned</strong> A banned user cannot access the forums, and cannot use the U2U function. You can ban a user
by going to Administration Panel &gt; Members, searching for the member and setting their "Avatar & Member Status:" to
"Banned" then in the "Banned From" column choose the extent of the ban. The options are: u2u, posting and u2u/posting.
To ban a member's IP, go to the Administration Panel and click on IP Banning. Then enter the IP address that you want
to ban from the forums.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How do I set the ranks? And how do I make a member a moderator of a particular
forum?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> To change the rank of a member you will enter your Administration Panel and click on the
"Members" link. Then you will enter the member's name in the "Search for user:" field and click the "Display Results"
button. When the results are displayed you will see the following options: Delete | Username | New Password | Posts |
Avatar & Member Status: | Custom Status | Banned From To set that member to a new rank you will use the drop down menu
under "Avatar & Member Status:". The available options are" Super Administrator, Administrator, Super Moderator,
Moderator, Member and Banned. Choose the rank you wish to set for that member and click "Submit Changes". To set
Moderators (see FAQ #1 - Moderators must be "assigned" to a forum(s) to be effective) - Go to the Administration Panel
and click on the "Moderators" link. Here you will find a column for "Forum: and a column for "Moderator:". Simply put
the prospective Moderator's username in the field opposite the forum you wish to assign them to.</p>

<hr noshade />
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How do I use the "Admin Options" in the bottom left corner of each thread - what do they
do?<br />
 <strong>ANSWER:</strong> Below are descriptions of each of the moderator tools:</p>

<p>Delete Thread - Delete the thread and all posts within it<br />
Close Thread - Close the thread, disabling posting for all members of all ranks. However, ranks with moderation tools
can Open the thread again.<br />
Move Thread - Move the thread to another forum, with the option of leaving a redirect in its old location.<br />
Top Thread - This pins the thread to the top of the forum, meaning it cannot move down the forum under other
topics.<br />
Split Thread - This takes a selected amount of posts in a thread and places them into another new topic.<br />
Merge Thread - This takes two threads and combines all their posts together into one thread.<br />
Bump Thread - This "bumps" the thread to the top of the forum, like Top Thread, except it can be overtaking by other
threads again.<br />
Copy Thread - This will copy, thus leaving the original thread in place, a thread to a new forum.<br />
Prune Thread - This allows you to remove a certain amount of posts from a thread.<br />
</p>

<p>Moderators and other members of higher rank can also edit posts. However, a user cannot edit a post of a user who
has a higher rank, for example: A Super Moderator cannot edit the post of a Administrator. This setting can be altered
by going to the Settings section of the Administration Panel and changing the setting "Allow Rank Editing?".</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I would like to put my own logo in the header - how do I replace the XMB logo with my
own?<br />
 <strong>ANSWER:</strong> There are a couple of easy ways to do this-but first let me explain that the logo is unique
to each theme. For each theme, that comes installed with your forums, there is a corresponding "images" folder in the
forums "images" folder on your server. It is within that theme's folder that the images, including the header logo, are
stored. So with that in mind... 1. The first method of replacing the XMB logo is to go to your Administration Panel and
click on the "Themes" link. Then click the "Details" link next to a theme's name. Scroll down to "Board Logo URL..."
and note the file name of the image that is in that field. Now use that exact name, and image format, to name your
custom logo. Then simply upload your logo to the theme's image folder - thus replacing the XMB logo with yours. 2. The
second method is just as easy. You may retain the image name of your logo as is. Just upload your logo to the theme's
image folder, then go to the Administration Panel - click on "Themes" - then "Details" for the theme you wish to
replace the logo for and insert your logo's file name into the "Board Logo URL..." field. Note that you may have a
different logo per theme this way. Just visit each theme's "Details" and use one of the methods above.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Am I allowed to modify my boards, change appearance or add new features? And what is a
"hack"?<br />
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes - you allowed to modify your forums however you wish. You will find that a small amount of
HTML knowledge will be essential in modifying the templates (the templates are primarily just HTML code- like a web
page)and some knowledge of PHP and MySQL will be necessary for any modifications involving the actual files. "Hacks"
are pre-made modifications that people have put together to add or even subtract to/from the functionality of the
forums. These are generally instructions that require that you add, change or remove code from your files. It is
advised that you always back up your files before making any modifications. XMB has a special forum for finding and
seeking support for "hacks" - you will find it here: http://www.xmbhacks.co.uk/community/boards/ There is a great
support team in place there that will be happy to help you with your hack support questions.</p>

<hr noshade />
<p>These are just a few of the many possible questions you may have about your XMB forum. IF your question isn't
addressed here we urge you to:<br />
 1) Visit the support forums at either http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/ - or if you are a Premiere Member you
may get personalize support at our "members" forum - http://www.xmbforum.com/members/community/ - use the SEARCH
feature to search for keywords that describe the problem you are having. Chances are that other members have had the
same problem at some point and your search will bring up many threads/posts that will have a solution.<br />
 2) Check out our <a href="http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/forumdisplay.php?fid=176">How To Forum</a> - there
are many, many good "How Tos" on different aspects of troubleshooting, running and enjoying your forums.<br />
3) Post your question, with as much detail as you can, in the support forums (see above for urls to the support forums)
so that our Support Team can assist you. We hope that this document will help you to get a good start on setting up and
enjoying your new forums! Thanks!</p>
