XMB 1.9.1 Nexus - Installation Advice
______________________________________________________________________________

Thank you for choosing XMB 1.9.1 Nexus, created by Aventure Media & The XMB 
Group.

Below is a guide on how to Install XMB 1.9 Nexus.


1) Before you Begin

Make sure that you have enough webspace for your forum, and that your hosting
account includes both PHP and mySQL.

Create a database for your forums, using the mySQL Management Tool from your 
site's Control Panel.
- Please note the database name ($dbname), username ($dbuser) and password 
  ($dbpw).

2) Upload

Using FTP to your site, upload all of the XMB 1.9.1 Nexus files from the Files
folder in your downloaded package of XMB 1.9 Nexus.

Make config.php "world writable"

If you want to let the installation program update your config.php, you will
need to make config.php world writable. To do this, right click the file, then
click on CHMOD (other FTP programs may have Change Attributes), then check all
check marks in the window, or enter in 666 where it shows a textbox with the 
numbers: 644. Once installation is finished, you will want to set this back
to 644. Please note that on most hosts this is not a necessery step to take.
Leaving it with the default permissions seems to work just fine in most cases.

3) Installation

*** Please note that XMB 1.9 Nexus Final Installation is different from 
    older versions and builds. ***

Go to your forums, then input the url: /install
  - Example: http://www.mydomain.com/forums/install
  
You will see the Welcome Image to XMB 1.9 Nexus, click on it to begin 
installation.

The next page is the XMB Version Check. This is used to show you the current 
version of XMB. If there's a later version than what you have, please obtain
that and restart the process, as the newer version will be better, faster, 
and / or more secure.

Click on the 'Install XMB 1.9.1 Final' button to proceed.

Read the XMB 1.9.1 Nexus License Agreement, and if you agree, click 
'I agree to terms' button to proceed.

Configuration File Setup Page

If you have uploaded an already configured config.php, just click Next.

or 

If you have chosen to let the installer update your config.php:

* Input the required database name, username, password and full url forms. 
* Other settings there are optional, but you may activate them if you wish.
* Once finished editing defaults, click on the 'Configure' button to proceed.

The installer will now automatically install XMB into your database.

- If you have WARNINGS from the Installer, it will tell you why it has stopped
  the installation process, contact your host if it has issues related to PHP
  or MySQL versions.
  
- Scroll down to the end of the page, and click on 'here' to redirect to your 
  forums.

You are now prompted to create a new SuperAdministrator account. It's really easy;
Just input your desired username and password, and press the button.

The XMB installer will now proceed with installing, please be patient.

If the installation succeeds, but didn't manage to delete the installation 
files, you must delete the /install/ folder using FTP or the File Manager in 
cPanel.

4) Your Forum

Log in with the username and password you provided during Install.

To edit different aspects of your forum, click on Administration Panel. From
there, you will see links to different settings for your forums.
