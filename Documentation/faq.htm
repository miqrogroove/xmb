			<strong><a name="1">QUESTION</a>:</strong> What are the duties and differences
			between the staff ranks?<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Ranks are simply a method of differentiating different levels of users. In
				addition, ranks different authorization levels of staff.
			</p>
			<p>As users move up through post counts, they get different titles. There is no
				fundamental difference between a high post count member and a low post count
				member.
			</p>
			<p>Super Administrators can have very few posts but completely control the entire
				board - only by allocating privileges in the Member area in the Administration
				panel can you upgrade a user from a normal member to a privileged staff member.</p>
			<p>The rank system can be altered in Administration Panel &gt; User Ranks. A
				description of the moderation tools is also provided.</p>
			<p><strong>Super Administrator</strong> The Super Administrator is the highest
				rank. The first person to register on your board is automatically assigned this
				rank. They can use all of the moderation options in threads/posts in all
				forums, and they have access to every feature in the Administrator Panel.</p>
			<p><strong>Administrator</strong> The Administrator rank can moderate all forums
				and has access to nearly all of the administration panel. The only functions of
				the administration panel they cannot access is the Upgrade section. They also
				cannot read other member's u2u inboxes, or edit other member's profiles.</p>
			<p><strong>Super Moderator</strong> The Super Moderator has access to the
				moderating tools for all the forums, but they cannot access the administration
				panel.</p>
			<p><strong>Moderator</strong> Moderators has access to the moderating tools for a
				specified forum or forums. The forums that they moderate can be altered by an
				Administrator/Super Administrator by accessing the Administration Panel feature
				"Moderators".</p>
			<p><strong>Member</strong> The Member rank is the default rank that is set when a
				user registers. Under the default settings, members can post topics, reply to
				topics and edit their own posts in any public forum. However, this can be
				changed by altering the settings in Administration Panel &gt; Forums &gt; More
				Options.</p>
			<p><strong>Banned</strong> A banned user cannot access the forums, and cannot use
				the U2U function. You can ban a user by going to Administration Panel &gt;
				Members, searching for the member and setting their "Avatar &amp; Member
				Status:" to "Banned" then in the "Banned From" column choose the extent of the
				ban. The options are: u2u, posting and u2u/posting. To ban a member's IP, go to
				the Administration Panel and click on IP Banning. Then enter the IP address
				that you want to ban from the forums.</p>

			<p><strong><a name="2">QUESTION</a>:</strong> How do I set the ranks? And how do I
				make a member a moderator of a particular forum?</p>

			<p><strong><a name="3">QUESTION</a>:</strong> How do I use the "Admin Options" in
				the bottom left corner of each thread - what do they do?</p>
			<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Below are descriptions of each of the moderator tools:</p>
			<p>Delete Thread - Delete the thread and all posts within it<br>
				Close Thread - Close the thread, disabling posting for all members of all
				ranks. However, ranks with moderation tools can Open the thread again.<br>
				Move Thread - Move the thread to another forum, with the option of leaving a
				redirect in its old location.<br>
				Top Thread - This pins the thread to the top of the forum, meaning it cannot
				move down the forum under other topics.<br>
				Split Thread - This takes a selected amount of posts in a thread and places
				them into another new topic.<br>
				Merge Thread - This takes two threads and combines all their posts together
				into one thread.<br>
				Bump Thread - This "bumps" the thread to the top of the forum, like Top Thread,
				except it can be overtaking by other threads again.<br>
				Copy Thread - This will copy, thus leaving the original thread in place, a
				thread to a new forum.<br>
				Prune Thread - This allows you to remove a certain amount of posts from a
				thread.<br>
				Empty Thread - This allows you to remove all replies made by users, leaving
				only the initial post</p>
			<p>Moderators and other members of higher rank can also edit posts. However, a user
				cannot edit a post of a user who has a higher rank, for example: A Super
				Moderator cannot edit the post of a Administrator. This setting can be altered
				by going to the Settings section of the Administration Panel and changing the
				setting "Allow Rank Editing?".</p>

			<p><strong><a name="6">QUESTION</a>:</strong> How do I use BBCode? I don't
				understand exactly what it is!</p>

				your quickly format text in your posts; some examples and what they mean have
				been added below for your convenience.</p>

				[marquee] Text Here [/marquee] - This will scroll the text between the tags the
				width of the table post.<br>

			<p><strong><a name="7">QUESTION</a>:</strong> I would like to put my own logo in
				the header - how do I replace the XMB logo with my own?</p>
			<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> There are a couple of easy ways to do this. But first
				let me explain that the logo is unique to each theme. For each theme, that
				comes installed with your forums, there is a corresponding "images" folder in
				the forums "images" folder on your server.
			</p>
			<p>It is within that theme's folder that the images, including the header logo, are
				stored. So with that in mind...
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The first method of replacing the XMB logo is to go to your Administration
					Panel and click on the "Themes" link. Then click the "Details" link next to a
					theme's name. Scroll down to "Board Logo URL..." and note the file name of the
					image that is in that field. Now use that exact name, and image format, to name
					your custom logo. Then simply upload your logo to the theme's image folder -
					thus replacing the XMB logo with yours.<br>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The second method is just as easy. You may retain the image name of your logo
					as is. Just upload your logo to the theme's image folder, then go to the
					Administration Panel - click on "Themes" - then "Details" for the theme you
					wish to replace the logo for and insert your logo's file name into the "Board
					Logo URL..." field. Note that you may have a different logo per theme this way.
					Just visit each theme's "Details" and use one of the methods above.</li>

			<p><strong><a name="8">QUESTION</a>:</strong> Am I allowed to modify my boards,
				change appearance or add new features? And what is a "hack"?</p>
			<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes - you allowed to modify your forums and change the
				appearance as you wish.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>You will find that a small amount of HTML knowledge will be essential in
				modifying the templates (the templates are primarily just HTML code - like a
				web page) and some knowledge of PHP and MySQL will be necessary for any
				modifications involving the actual files.
			</p>
			<p>"Hacks" are pre-made modifications that people have put together to add or even
				subtract to/from the functionality of the forums. These are generally
				instructions that require that you add, change or remove code from your files.
				It is advised that you always back up your files before making any
				modifications.
			</p>
			<p>As of February 2004, xmbforum.com has stopped support for hack-related problems.</p>

			<p>These are just a few of the many possible questions you may have about your XMB
				forum. If your question has not been addressed by this document please visit

			<p>We hope that this document will help you to get a good start on setting up and
				enjoying your new forums!
