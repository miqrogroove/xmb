		<H1>Installation</H1>
		<p>Suitable for most operating systems including: Windows, MacOS X, FreeBSD,
			NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linux</p>
		<p>Please review the <a href="prereq.htm">Prerequisites</a> before you begin.</p>
		<p>Most web hosts run a version of Unix, such as Solaris or AIX, or a freely
			available versions such as FreeBSD (such as Yahoo and Pair Networks) or Linux
			(such as Aventure Media or EV1). As long as your hoster runs the required
			versions of MySQL and PHP, there’s no minimum or recommended operating system
			version.</p>
		<p>The basic installation process is as follows:
		</p>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Create a database for your forum
			<LI>
			Upload all files
			<LI>
				Do one of:
				<UL>
					<LI>
					Locally edit config.php and upload to your host
					<LI>
					Use the installation script to configure your config.php (may not work due to
					hoster's&nbsp;permissions) or
					<LI>
						Use the installation script to generate a config.php and upload to your host</LI></UL>
			<LI>
			Run the installation script and follow the instructions
			<LI>
				Logon and customize your forum</LI></UL>
		<p>Let’s go through these steps in detail.</p>
		<H2>Create the database</H2>
		<p>Make sure that you have enough web space for your forum, and that your hosting
			account includes both PHP and MySQL support.</p>
		<p>Create a database for your forums, using the MySQL Management Tool from your
			site's Control Panel or by using MySQL's administration tool directly. When you
			are creating the database, note the database name ($dbname), username ($dbuser)
			and password ($dbpw).
		</p>
		<p>In the following example, we will use the mysql command line tool to create the
			database. You should create a name and use usernames and passwords which are
			different, or else you will have a security issue.</p>
		<p class="progress">mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE xmb19;</p>
		<p class="progress">Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.03 sec)</p>
		<p class="progress">mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON xmb19.* TO
			'xmbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'foo123';</p>
		<p class="progress">Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)</p>
		<p>In the above example case, $dbname will be <i>xmb19</i>, $dbuser is <i>xmbuser</i>,
			and $dbpw is <i>foo123</i>. In addition, we have restricted database access to
			the localhost, which is fine if the database server is on the same host as the
			web server. If it is not the same, you should put in the fully qualified domain
			name of your web server in place of <i>localhost</i>.</p>
		<H2>Upload</H2>
		<p>Create a folder for your forum in your web space. How you do this is dependant
			upon your web host, but we will demonstrate here using cPanel, as it is very
			common:</p>
		<p align="center">
		</p>
		<p>Open the cPanel File Manager, navigate inside your public_html folder by
			clicking on the little folder icon on the left of “public_html”, and then click
			“Create New Folder”. You can use any name, but most people use “forum”.
		</p>
		<p>Whatever folder name you use is part of the $full_url variable, so if your site
			is located at <a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.example.com/">
				www.example.com</a>, and the name for the folder you created is “forum”,
			the value of $full_url will be <a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.example.com/forum/">
				http://www.example.com/forum/</a>
		</p>
		<p>If you want, you can simply use the top level of your account, but this means
			your account will display the forum by default, which may not be what you had
			in mind.</p>
		<p>Alternatives to cPanel include using Frontpage (WebDAV), ftp’s “mkdir” command
			or logging on directly to your host using telnet or ssh and using Unix’s
			“mkdir” command.
		</p>
		<p>Upload all the files from the distribution to your site. Everything in the
			"Files" folder requires uploading, including all sub-folders and files.
		</p>
		<P align="center"><IMG src="images/image001.jpg"></P>
		<p align="center">Figure 1: Files to be uploaded</p>
		<p>You should use “binary” to ensure that the XMB is correctly transferred to your
			host. Most FTP clients do this automatically for you, but if you are using a
			command line ftp client, use the “bin” command prior to transferring.</p>
		<p>You must create each of the folders and upload each of the files within the
			“db”, “images”, “include”, “install” and “lang” folders or else XMB will not
			function.</p>
		<H2>Configure config.php</H2>
		<p>There are two methods of installing XMB: configuring config.php manually or
			automatically. There are pros and cons for each. Experienced users will
			probably prefer to use the manual method and first time administrators will
			probably prefer to use the automatic method.
		</p>
		<p><i><STRONG>Manual configuration</STRONG></i></p>
		<p>Edit config.php in your favorite text editor. The only fields which MUST be
			changed are:</p>
		<P>
			<TABLE id="Table1" height="88" cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="1" width="456" border="1">
				<TR>
					<TD width="107" height="16">$dbname</TD>
					<TD height="16">MySQL database name</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD width="107">$dbuser</TD>
					<TD>MySQL database user</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD width="107">$dbpasswd</TD>
					<TD>MySQL database password</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD width="107">$full_url
					</TD>
					<TD>The full URL to your forum, including a trailing slash</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD width="107">$tablepre
					</TD>
					<TD>The table prefixes. Normally xmb_</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
		</P>
		<p class="progress">&nbsp;<b><FONT face="Wingdings" size="6">M</FONT> You MUST make
				sure that the last line and characters in config.php are ?&gt;</b></p>
		<p><b>Do not add any lines or convert this file to DOS format or XMB will not work. </b>
		</p>
		<p>Once you have edited config.php to your satisfaction, upload it (in binary mode
			if using ftp), over-writing the previous copy of config.php.
		</p>
		<p>Skip ahead to the installation section.
		</p>
		<p><i><STRONG>Automatic configuration</STRONG></i></p>
		<p><FONT class="mediumtxt">Automatic configuration requires a temporary weakening of
				file permissions (security) during installation <EM>on </EM>most systems.<BR>
				<BR>
				There are many ways to achieve this. In many graphical FTP clients, you right
				click on a file and choose chmod or Change Attributes or something similar.
				Then check all check marks in the permissions area pertaining to write or read,
				or enter 666 where it shows a textbox with the numbers: 644. This represents:</FONT>
		</p>
		<p style="MARGIN-LEFT:3cm">user: read/write
		</p>
		<p style="MARGIN-LEFT:3cm">group: read/write
		</p>
		<p style="MARGIN-LEFT:3cm">other: read/write
		</p>
		<p>You may need to do this in your host's CPanel or via shell access. If you can't
			work it out, ask your host for help.</p>
		<p><FONT face="Wingdings" size="6">N</FONT> <b>With file permissions set to
				world-writable (mode 666),</b> <b>anyone on the Internet could take over your
				forum, so make sure you check or change the permissions back to 644 after you
				have installed XMB. </b>
		</p>
		<p>XMB’s installer tries to automatically change the file permissions of config.php
			after installation has finished, but some security conscious hosts do not allow
			this functionality, so it does not always work. All XMB files should be mode
			644 once installation is complete.</p>
		<H2>Installation</H2>
		<p class="progress"><b><FONT face="Wingdings" size="6">G</FONT> </b>Please note
			that the XMB 1.9.2 (Nexus) installation method is different from older
			versions, including beta versions of 1.9.
		</p>
		<p>Start your web browser
		</p>
		<p>Input the URL where your forum will be located and then add /install/index.php
			to the end. Example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.example.com/forums/install/index.php">
				http://www.example.com/forums/install/index.php</a>
		</p>
		<p>If you have typed the installation URL correctly, you will see the following
			image:
		</p>
		<p align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN:center">
			<img border="0" src="images/step1.jpg"></p>
		<p>Click on it to begin installation.
		</p>
		<p>The second page is the XMB Version Check. This is used to show you the most
			recent build of XMB Forum. If your version is earlier, go get a later version
			as it'll be more secure and contain fewer bugs.
		</p>
		<p align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN:center">
			<img border="0" src="images/step2.jpg"></p>
		<p>However, if you have the latest version, click on the 'Install XMB 1.9.2' button
			to proceed.
		</p>
		<p>Read and understand the XMB 1.9.2 Nexus License Agreement, which is the GNU GPL
			version 2. If you're prepared to accept it, 'I agree to terms' button to
			proceed.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="images/step3.jpg"></p>
		<p>Next up is the Configuration File Setup Page. This is the most important step.
			Input the required database name, username, password from above where you
			configured the database.
		</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="images/step4.jpg"></p>
		<p>The only other mandatory field is "Full URL". The Full URL helps the forum base
			itself relative to wherever you need it, and allows you to move XMB easily
			between hosters if you need it.
		</p>
		<p>If your forum is going to be at
		</p>
		<p>
			<a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.example.com/forum/">
				http://www.example.com/forum/</a>
		</p>
		<p>then, that's the full URL. Simple! Remember to put a slash at the end.
		</p>
		<p>The other settings are optional, but you may activate them if you wish. The most
			important to note is "ipreg". This is not a useful setting in many countries
			where ISPs use transparent proxies. Leaving this in the "on" state stops more
			than a couple of registrations per day.
		</p>
		<p>Once finished with the configuration choices, click on the 'Configure' button to
			proceed. If the file permissions on config.php are correct, XMB will have
			written out a correct config.php.
		</p>
		<p>You need to set an Super Administrator password. This is a new feature since
			earlier versions of XMB.</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="images/step5.jpg"></p>
		<p>Do not choose a name like "admin" or "Administrator" or "root". Be creative. The
			password be complex - more than 8 characters long, and contain numbers and
			punctuation marks.</p>
		<p>The installer automatically installs XMB 1.9.2 Nexus on to your database.</p>
		<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="images/step6.jpg"></p>
		<p>Scroll down to the end of the page, and click on 'here' to redirect to your
			forums.
		</p>
		<p><b><FONT face="Wingdings" size="6">M</FONT> If you have WARNINGS from the Installer,
				it will tell you why it has stopped the installation process. Contact your host
				if it has issues related to PHP or mySQL versions.</b></p>
		<H2>Post-installation Checks</H2>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Make sure the file permissions of all files, including config.php, are mode 644
			(or user: read/write, group and other: read only).
			<LI>
			Directories should be mode 755 (or user: read/write/execute, group and other:
			read and execute), but can also be 711 (or user: read/write/execute, group and
			other: execute only)
			<LI>
				If it still exists, delete the /install/ folder using FTP, shell or your host’s
				control panel.</LI></UL>
		<H2>Customizing Your Forum</H2>
		<p>Now that you have successfully installed XMB, you can make it your own.</p>
		<p>
			You can modify or create a new theme, or add what are termed “hacks” to your
			forum to provide additional functionality.
