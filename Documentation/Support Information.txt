XMB 1.9 Nexus - Support Information

Need help? The first place to look is the official xmb forums which can be found at
http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/

Our suggestions for the best support is to:

1) Visit the support forums at either http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/ - or if you are a Premiere Member you may get priority support at our "members" forum - http://www.xmbforum.com/members/community/ - use the SEARCH feature to search for keywords that describe the problem you are having. Chances are that other members have had the same problem at some point and your search will bring up many threads/posts that will have a solution.

2) Check out our How To Forum - http://www.xmbforum.com/community/boards/forumdisplay.php?fid=176 - there are many, many good "How Tos" on different aspects of troubleshooting, running and enjoying your forums. 

3) Post your question, with as much detail as you can, in the support forums (see above for urls to the support forums) so that our Support Team can assist you.


If you need more advanced, priority support you can purchase an XMB Members Subscription.
This subscription is available for $27.99 and gives you access to the XMB Members Area,
here you can discuss your issues in the private members forum, with answers usually within
30 minutes. You can also get smilie packs, theme packs, customer service, telephone support,
