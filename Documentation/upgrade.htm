		<h2>Before you start</h2>
		<p>Please check the Prerequisites before you start to upgrade. Generally, if you
			can run a prior version of XMB, you will be able to run XMB 1.9.5</p>
		<p><a href="prereq.htm">Prerequisites</a>
		</p>
		<p>Also note that upgrading to XMB 1.9.5 is a one way process. If you need to back
			out, you will need to restore from backup.
		</p>
		<h2>Compatibility</h2>
		<p>Upgrades from XMB 1.6 and higher have been tested, including 1.8 and 1.9 beta. If you
			have earlier versions, this upgrade script may work, but it has not been
			tested.</p>
		<p>Files used by the backup process:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			upgrade.lib.php
			<li>
			upgrade.php
			<li>
			install.css
			<li>
				XMB_*.xmb (at the time of writing, XMB_1_9_4.xmb)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			createFile.php creates the schema for XMB developers.</p>
		<h2>Known issues with upgrade</h2>
		<p>These issues are known. Most issues affect only a small percentage of users.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			The upgrade can be quite resource-intensive, especially with large databases.
			<li>
			The script might time out or look to be inactive - do not stop it or close the
			browser window
			<li>
			The script can consume up to twice the amount of disk space you are currently
			using. Make sure you have enough room!
			<li>
			The upgrade script cannot cope with some indexes. If upgrade stops whilst
			trying to drop, alter or add an index, you will need to remove all indexes from
			the affected table. It's safe to remove as many indexes as possible as the
			upgrade script will put back the ones it needs. After dropping all additional
			indexes, simply restart the upgrade process.
			<li>
				The upgrade script occasionally cannot handle out of order columns,
				particularly in xmb_settings. If upgrade stops whilst performing a change to
				any table, you will need to change the table yourself. Once the table is closer
				to XMB's schema, just re-run upgrade.php</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>WARNING: Hacks and data loss<br>
			<br>
			<font color="#ff0000">!!! </font>
		</h2>
		<h2><font color="#ff0000">This upgrade is designed to work when hacks are installed.
				However, all hack data including templates and code will be destroyed by the
				upgrade process! Proceed with extreme caution if you want to keep your hack
				data </font>
		</h2>
		<h2><font color="#ff0000">!!!</font></h2>
		<p>Disable posting to your board in Admin -&gt; Settings<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Backups</h2>
		<p><font color="#ff0000">Always take a backup before using *ANY* upgrade script!
				Although this is common sense, it's often forgotten.
				<br>
			</font>
			<br>
			0. Backup your database
			<br>
			1. Backup all your forum's files</p>
		<p><font color="#ff0000">If you have not performed a backup, XMB cannot help you if
				something goes wrong. You could lose all your data, posts, and users. You have
				been warned. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font color="#ff0000">Do not proceed after this step if you have not performed a
				comprehensive backup.</font></p>
		<p>2. Upload all of Nexus 1.9's files over the top of your existing forum files<br>
			3. Delete ./install/<br>
			4. Edit the new config.php to suit your needs<br>
			5. Upload the upgrade folder your forum<br>
			6. Run <A href="http://www.example.com/pathtoyourforum/upgrade/upgrade.php">http://www.example.com/pathtoyourforum/upgrade/upgrade.php</A>
			<br>
			7. When it succeeds, check that the upgrade folder has been deleted.<br>
			8. Log on your shiny new 1.9.5 board
			<br>
			9. Turn on the board in Admin -&gt; Settings.
		</p>
		<p>Adjust other new settings as you see fit.
		</p>
		<h2>Keeping XMB healthy</h2>
		<p>If your database is not looked after regularly, it can slow down. XMB 1.9.5 has
			many performance improvements which can be best utilized with a healthy
			database. XMB recommends administrators use Admin -&gt; Analyze on their
			databases weekly, followed by Admin -&gt; Optimize. This keeps your board in
			the best possible shape. Try it now!<br>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Basic system administration</h2>
		<p>You should find out if your hoster performs regular backups for you. If they
			don't, you need to take backups manually. XMB 1.9.5 has a backup utility, but
			it is best if you use your hoster's utilities (such as phpMyAdmin or the
			mysqldump tool for this purpose).
		</p>
		<p>Backups should be taken about once a week, and more often for very busy sites.</p>
		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>All software has bugs, XMB included. You should check back with
			http://www.xmbforum.com/ regularly to see if you need to install patches.
		</p>
		<p>When customizing your board, remember the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Changes to themes are supported
			<li>
				Modifications to XMB's PHP files, or to the database schema, or altering
				templates within the
				<br>
				Admin -&gt; Templates area makes it much harder for *YOU* to upgrade to the
				next service pack or a<br>
			later version of XMB.
			<li>
				Try to keep the number of hacks down, and consider using "diff" to allow you to
				reapply them if you need<br>
				to reload XMB from scratch.
			</li>
		</ul>
