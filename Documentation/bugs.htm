		<H2>Known bugs in 1.9.5</H2>
		<UL>
			<LI>Voting in polls is impossible under certain conditions.
			<li>Pruning threads via the admin panel does not update last posts.
			<li>Templates are no longer (all) XHTML 1.0 Transitional Valid!
			<li>Advanced BBcode mode in IE gives JavaScript errors.
			</UL>
		<P>These bugs will not be fixed until XMB 1.10.0</P>
		<H3>Known problems which cannot be resolved</H3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			If you upgraded from 1.8 to 1.9.1 betas through to 1.9.1 or later, u2u counts will be
			wrong
			<LI>
				Double entries in tables. Eg. double whosonline entries, double member entries,
				etc.<BR>
				To properly fix this requires transaction logging, which is not supported with
				the current code architecture
			</LI>
		</ul>
		<p>There's nothing which can be done to fix this as the new code correctly handles
			counting new U2U's, but the old data is incorrect and it's impossible to
			determine which old u2u's belong to which users.</p>
