Known Bugs in XMB 1.9.1

These bugs have been identified, but will not be fixed in xmb 1.x:
- double entries in tables. Eg. double whosonline entries, double member entries, etc. (this requires transaction logging, which is not supported with the current code architecture)

These bugs are being worked on; any help is welcome:
- Edit page not showing in pw-forums
- Admin Panel >> Prune threads syntax error
- Creating a superAdministrator Account during install is very delicate currently.
- When a notification of a new U2U is sent via email, sometimes the email seems to come from INVALID_ADDRESS@.SYNTAX-ERROR

These bugs will not be fixed till XMB 1.9.2:
- Voting in polls is impossible under certain conditions.
- Moderators can't edit own pages when post replies is set to 'No Posting'
- Expiry behavior in post.php (using the Back button does not always work correctly)
- Insert Raw SQL breaks when more than 1 query is issued, and an error appears in the middle.
