# Welcome to XMB

Our code moved to GitHub on 1 January 2025.

The Master branch is now XMB 1.10 Beta.

Visit [xmbforum2.com](https://www.xmbforum2.com) for more resources.

## Getting Started (ZIP)

Copy and unpack the XMB files to your web server.  Visit the `/install/` path to complete the setup.

You will need a MySQL database and connection details to get started.

## Getting Started (Clone)

The clone method enables you to pull future updates from the master branch on demand.

Composer is required.  Install it according to the [instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

Create a directory for the site.  Make sure it's not owned by the root user.

Clone XMB into the current directory using `git clone https://github.com/miqrogroove/xmb.git ./`

Install the XMB dependencies using `composer install` in the same directory.  This should be repeated after each pull.

If attempting to upgrade an existing site, remember to copy any customizations of config and images (themes and smilies).

Visit the `/install/` path on the website to complete the setup.

## Getting Involved

Issues, requests, discussions, and reports are all welcome here.  Note that we have a primary forum and bug tracker on our website.

If you would like to contribute or collaborate, feel free to offer ideas.  This project needs a website designer and more.
