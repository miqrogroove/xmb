# Welcome to XMB

Our code moved to GitHub on 1 January 2025.

This is Branch 1.9.12, containing the latest stable patches for XMB v1.9.12.  It is compatible with PHP 7 and PHP 8.

Visit [xmbforum2.com](https://www.xmbforum2.com) for more resources.

## Getting Started

Copy the XMB files to your web server.  Keep the "install" or "upgrade" folder as needed and delete the other one.

You will need a MySQL database and connection details to get started.

## Getting Involved

Issues, requests, discussions, and reports are all welcome here.  Note that we have a primary forum and bug tracker on our website.

If you would like to contribute or collaborate, feel free to offer ideas.  This project needs a website designer and more.

## Credits

There are many people to thank for decades of development, so look in [the Contributors file](CONTRIBUTORS.md).
