Notes For IIS Users

The file index_add.php which is used to collect information for the admin raw logs uses
commands which IIS does not support. Using this will cause major errors to show on the
top of all forum pages. To fix this, you must disable raw logs.

To disable logging, please follow these steps.



 1) Open index.php
 2) You will see around line 11, when you find these 3 lines, select and delete them.

 
		 include "index_add.php"
