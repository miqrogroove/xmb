XMB 1.6 Magic Lantern Credits

  Since Febuary 2002, the new administators, developers and moderators of XMB
  worked for hours everyday and sometimes they  were sitting at their desks at 6am
  in the morning working on XMB to try and release it as quickly as possible. 

  Over the past 2 months the main developers created an added to an amazing platform
  and the result was XMB 1.6 New features, new security new additions and new services 
  came with the new XMB team.

  We would also like to think IMinteractive (IMinteractive.net) who sponsored XMB and
  provided us with web hosting for xmbforum.com, without them, xmb could not have
  continued.

  The people who created XMB can be found below.
