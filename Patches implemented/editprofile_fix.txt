[Resolved] edit profile error

I was changing a member's password from the editprofile page and I was given this error.

Warning: No ending delimiter '"' found in /home/xpressht/public_html/forum/editprofile.php on line 235

Warning: No ending delimiter ''' found in /home/xpressht/public_html/forum/editprofile.php on line 235

On line 235 of the edit profile page it has...


if(preg_match('"', $newpassword) || preg_match("'", $newpassword)) {

Change to:


if(strstr($newpassword, '"') || strstr($newpassword, "'")) {
