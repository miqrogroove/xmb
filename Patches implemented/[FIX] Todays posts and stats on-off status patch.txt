[FIX] Todays posts and stats on-off status patch

Description: Special thanks goes to Sohil for bringing this to my attention. I made a patch to correct the missing 
code for the Todays Posts on/off function but then learned that the stats on/off was missing to. This is a compiled
text file of both missing on/off controls in the settings panel in admin panel.

Note: These are not hacks but missing code. The database content is already stored in xmb for these. It is a simple case
of oversight for several builds now.


Step 1:

Open: cp.php

Find Code:

if($SETTINGS['bbrules'] == "on") {
$ruleson = "selected=\"selected\"";
} else {
$rulesoff = "selected=\"selected\"";
}

Add Code Below:

if($SETTINGS['todaysposts'] == "on") {
$todayspostson = "selected=\"selected\"";
} else {
$todayspostsoff = "selected=\"selected\"";
}

if($SETTINGS['stats'] == "on") {
$statson = "selected=\"selected\"";
} else {
$statsoff = "selected=\"selected\"";
}


Step 2:

Find Code:

printsetting1($lang_textsearchstatus, "searchstatusnew", $searchon, $searchoff, $langfile);

Add Code Above:

printsetting1($lang_todayspostsstatus, "todayspostsnew", $todayspostson, $todayspostsoff, $langfile);
printsetting1($lang_statssatus, "statsnew", $statson, $statsoff, $langfile);


Step 3:

Find Code:

, bbrulestxt='$bbrulestxtnew'

Add Code Right After:

, todaysposts='$todayspostsnew', stats='$statsnew'


Now go to admin panel->settings and look above the Search Status Switch and you will see both on/off switches that have been missing.
