rank sort change : - )

not really a fix, but more of a looks better. You can see the ranks by order of stars then post. (unless someone wants to be strange and give less stars for more posts then this looks funny) 

in cp2.php 
find: 
$query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM $table_ranks ORDER BY id"); 

replace with: 
$query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM $table_ranks ORDER BY stars, posts");
