Simple fix to allow proper functioning of searches and all with regard to usernames
that have spaces in them....

As proposed by fisico on xmbforums



In misc.php,

FIND (approximately line 15):

require "./header.php"; 

ADD JUST BELOW THAT:

$member = str_replace("%20", "+", $member);
